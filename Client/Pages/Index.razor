                <p>
                    Hi there! I'm Daniel, a computer science student at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. I have a
                    diverse
                    background in engineering and technology and I'm passionate about computer science and software
                    development.
                    <br><br>
                    In 2019 I graduated from Miami University of Ohio with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering.
                    I gained some professional experience working as a Sales Engineer and a Project Manager before continuing 
                    my education at UT.

                    I currently work at the University of Tennessee in the Department of Technology Solutions as a Full Stack Development Intern. 
                    I collaborate with a small team of talented developers to create enterprise web applications using C# and Microsoft's .NET framework.
                    <br><br>
                    Over this past summer I gained a lot of experience from my work on a Blazor Server application that will be used by UT's Emergency Management Department and I'm very proud to have 
                    written code that will be used in production. I learned a lot about writing web apps in C# by implementing validation, authentication, and authorization features. I was also able to hone
                    my knowledge of html and css through my work on the site's frontend. I will post the link to the site here when it is up and running!

                    The first position I held at the University of Tennessee was an Information Technology Internship in the Department of Technology Solutions. 
                    Before moving to the role of a Full Stack Development Intern, I worked with a team of IT Technicians and Security Engineers to provide technical support for UT Administration staff. 
                    I gained a lot of experience helping users troubleshoot a wide variety of technical issues involving both hardware and software. 
                    I learned a lot about information security principles, troubleshooting techniques, and computer networks.

            I attended my very first hackathon at HackMIT 2023 and it was such an amazing experience! There was so much
            I learned over the course of just 24 hours.

            I worked with an amazing, passionate team of computer science students from all over the country. We had such 
            a fun time implementing our project and we plan to continue collaborating on projects in the future.

            Our idea was inspired by our personal experience with transportation issues on 
            college campuses. We wanted to create a platform to provide students with ease of transportation
            while contributing to a safer and more environmentally friendly campus.
            <br><br>
            We came up with StudyRide, a ride sharing
            service specifically designed for college campuses. Our application allows users on campus to connect and find others
            going to the same place that they can carpool with. The mission of our platform is to reduce transportation
            costs while promoting a more sustainable mode of travel, contriuting to a cleaner and safer campus.

        <h3>NASA API Call - Astronomy Picture of the Day</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            This summer, I've had the opportunity to learn a lot about web development. I've really enjoyed learning about APIs, understanding their implementation and how to interact with them. 
            Here, I'm fetching and displaying NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day through a simple API call! 
            <br><br>
            It took some time to find the best solution for securely storing the API key. My original plan for this site was just using Blazor WebAssembly and hosting the site as a static web app. 
            However, due to the nature of Blazor WebAssembly running everything on the client side, there is no real way to securely store secrets like keys, passwords, or certificates. So instead
            I implemented an ASP.NET Core backend to host the Blazor WASM frontend. It's a little more complicated but offers a lot more functionality!
